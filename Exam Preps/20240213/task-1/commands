# nothing fancy here
# add the projet to github
# go to azure and create new webapp + database
# keep in mind that the region can give you problems (It worked with Poland)
# copy the database name that mongodb generates (examprep-chebishev-database)
# Do not forget to add the environment variables:
DATABASE_NAME, DATABASE_URL (get it from the generated connection string in the App configuration panel)
# deploy the project from github from the app deploy center
# that's it
# the app was accessible here:
https://examprep-chebishev.azurewebsites.net/
# so I am deleting the resource group
az group delete --name examprep-chebishev
# output:
PS C:\Users\hp\SoftuniContainersAndCloud> az group delete --name chebishev-task1-rg
